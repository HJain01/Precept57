What the precept does

### Precept 35

> _Up is Up, Down is Down._ If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to
> lose your bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this Precept in mind!

The `up` direction is noted with "Up" and the `down` direction is noted with
"Down", so you always know which way is which.

### Precept 38

> _Beware the Mysterious Force._ A mysterious force bears down on us from above,
> pushing us downwards. If you spend too long in the air, the force will crush 
> you against the ground and destroy you. Beware!

You now take damage from high falls. The damage scales with the height of the 
fall, except you cannot die from falls (leaving at least one mask).
