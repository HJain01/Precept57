What the precept does
### Precept 9

> _Keep Your Home Tidy._ Your home is where you keep your most prized possession - yourself. Therefore, you should make an effort to keep it nice and clean.

Littering is bad. You'll be charged for all uncollected geo when leaving an area.


### Precept 35

> _Up is Up, Down is Down._ If you fall over in the darkness, it can be easy to lose your bearing and forget which way is up. Keep this Precept in mind!

The `up` direction is noted with "Up" and the `down` direction is noted with
"Down", so you always know which way is which.
